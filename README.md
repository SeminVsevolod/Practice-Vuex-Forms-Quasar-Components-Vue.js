# Exercise 3. Practice Vuex, Forms, Quasar Components & Vue.js

~~1) Create a Vuex Store for the food items, with the four different sections and add the food data to the appropriate section~~

~~2) Create a getter to retreive the food and display these on the page using the getter~~

3) Add the ability to delete an item (when the user clicks Delete) using actions & mutations - show a confirm dialog before deleting

4) Add validation to the Add / Edit Food modal - make the Name a required field with a max of 20 characters. Make description not required, but with a max of 135 characters. Validation should be triggered when Save is clicked

5) Add the ability to Add an item (hint: both Add and Edit modals use the same component - use the 'type' prop to differentiate)

6) Add the ability to Edit an item

7) If no description is provided for a food item, display the text "No description provided." in italic text

8) If no image is provided, fall back to the image statics/image-placeholder.png
